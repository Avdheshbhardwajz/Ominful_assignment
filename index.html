    <!-- 
    defer: The script is executed after the HTML document has been fully parsed.
    This ensures that the DOM is ready before the script runs, preserving the
    order of execution if multiple scripts are used. It's ideal for scripts that
    interact with the DOM. 
    
    async: The script is executed as soon as it is
    downloaded, potentially before the HTML document is fully parsed. This is
    suitable for scripts that don't depend on the DOM or other scripts. -->
